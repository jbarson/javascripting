//In that file define a variable named roundUp that references the float 1.5.
//We will use the Math.round() method to round the number up.
//An example of using Math.round():
//Math.round(0.5);
//Define a second variable named rounded that references the output of the Math.round() method, passing in the roundUp variable as the argument.
//Use console.log() to print that number to the terminal.
var num = 1.5;
var rounded = Math.round(num);
